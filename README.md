- [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Navigation to the project directory:
    - cd Message-Board_Prototype

2. Install dependencies for backend: 
    - cd backend
    - npm install express body-parser
3. Install dependencies for frontend:
    - cd frontend
    - npx create-react-app react-board

## Technologies Used
 - React
 - Axios
 - Material-UI
 - NodeJS
 - Express
 
 ## Implementation Overview

 - Implemented
    - The backend is implemented using NodeJS and Express.
    - Three main routes are implemented:  
        - GET endpoint for querying channels: http://localhost:3001/channels
        - GET endpoint for querying channelâ€™s messages: http://localhost:3001/messages/:channel
        - POST endpoint for submitting new messages to a channel:http://locahost:3001/:channel
    - In-memory storage is used to store channels and messages.
    - The frontend is developed using React.
    - Components include ChannelList, ChannelMessages.
    - Channels are loaded on application load, and messages are loaded dynamically based on     
      channel selection.
- What's Missing or Could Be Improved
    - Better error Handling
    - Smoooth UI-Design.
    - use of real database to persist the channels and user messages
    - Authorization and authentication
